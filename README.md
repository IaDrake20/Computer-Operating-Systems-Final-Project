Instructions are listed with the files.

TODO:
  Build public header
  Run queue test successfully
  test event communication between threads
  Write example_code file to demonstrate a mix of IO and CPU bound
operations distributed over multiple event loops. The IO may be via stdin,
stdout, or files. The code should demonstrate how to communicate bidi-
rectionally between event loops (requests and acknowledgments) and how to
shut down event loops in a clean way.
